This project involved designing a traffic light controller using VHDL in Quartus II, with traffic light transitions modeled using a finite state machine (FSM). The system featured a main street and a side street. The Altera DE2 board was used for user input and displaying the traffic lights for both streets. Users could set the green light duration for both streets. The main street light would stay green until a car was detected on the side street, at which point the main street light would transition through green, yellow, and red. Once the main street light turned red, the side street light would turn green for a fixed duration, then transition through yellow and red. The main street light would remain green indefinitely until a new car was detected on the side street. The board visually displayed the traffic light status for both streets, providing real-time feedback of the system's operation.
